## Goals

1. be able to generate a single `ffi.dart` file that should contain all the C header bindings.
2. Current Supported C Features

- [x] Functions
- [x] Function Pointer (aka Callbacks)
- [x] Simple Structs (NOTE: Nested structs is not supported yet, open a PR?)
- [x] C Enums

## Non-Goals

Writing a High-Level Abstractions and idiomatic Dart Code for the FFI bindgens, we will leave that as a homework for the user :).

## Install

Make sure you have installed the dependencies:

1. LLVM and clang

#### on macOS:

```
brew install llvm
```

#### on Windows:

Download a prebuild from [here](https://releases.llvm.org/)

#### on Linux:

you know what to do ;)

---

and then you could install the CLI from [github releases](https://github.com/sunshine-protocol/dart-bindgen/releases) or you could also use cargo to build it from source:

```bash
$ cargo install --force dart-bindgen --features cli
```

## Safety

This crate uses `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in
100% Safe Rust.
